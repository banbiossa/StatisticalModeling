# What's the best model?

```{r full model}
setwd("/Users//shota/git/StatisticalModeling/")
download.file("http://hosho.ees.hokudai.ac.jp/~kubo/stat/iwanamibook/fig/poisson/data3a.csv","data3.csv","curl")
d <- read.csv("data3.csv")
sum(log(dpois(d$y, lambda = d$y)))
```

```{r null model}
fit.null <- glm(formula = y ~ 1, family = poisson, data = d)
fit.null
logLik(fit.null)
```

## AIC (Akaike's information criterion)

AIC = D + 2k  
when k: number of parameters  
D: log likelyhood

### Bias  
The estimated bias  of a log likelyhood model will always be   
log(L) - k  
Therefor it is natural that AIC should be calculated as 
AIC = -2 * (log(L) - k)
